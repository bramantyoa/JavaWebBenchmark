JavaWebBenchmark is a tool to measure response time, built using Java and is multithreaded. If you need a great tool to measure server performance and built using Java, check out [Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/). I start this project to get my hands on multithreading, and I am currently measuring web server performance for my research. I want to try to develop the tool by myself.

### Try the program
---
1. Download the JAR file [here](https://github.com/bramantyoa/JavaWebBenchmark/raw/master/dist/JavaWebBenchmark.jar)

2. Run the JAR file or just double click the JAR file
```sh
$ java -jar JavaWebBenchmark.jar
```

### Get a Copy and Develop Yourself
---
I use NetBeans 8.2 and JDK 8u131, you can download it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html).

1. Clone this repository or you can just download it [here](https://github.com/bramantyoa/JavaWebBenchmark/archive/master.zip).
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:bramantyoa/JavaWebBenchmark.git /JavaWebBenchmark
```

2. Open NetBeans IDE
File > Open Project... > Select the directory where you put the downloaded copy of this repository
